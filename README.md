Good Day!

This is my first repository.

I'm Jan Ric Hogat, 19 years of age and I'm such a fond of doing hands-on projects.
Also, I'm interested in computer programming that's why I'm here on this platform.
As a beginner, I know this will help me to learn more in this matter with the help of other programmers and developers.

That's all and thank you in advance for helping me to be a better programmer.
