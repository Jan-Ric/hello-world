# Welcome to my Profile!

Good Day!

I'm Jan Ric Hogat, an aspiring ECE license holder and recent graduate with a passion for AI and Data Science.
I created this repository as my very first step into the world of programming and collaboration.
Right now, I’m on a journey to become an AI Solutions Architect.
I believe this platform will help me learn, grow, and connect with amazing programmers and developers along the way.

That’s all, and thank you in advance, folks! I’m happy to share my projects and progress!
